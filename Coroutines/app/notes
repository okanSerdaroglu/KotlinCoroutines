** Coroutine is not a thread. Coroutine means is a job

    --- Thread ----
       * Job#1 (coroutine 1)
       * Job#2 (coroutine 2)
       * Job#3 (coroutine 3)

** These jobs are coroutines and can be done in the same thread.
   Coroutine means a job.

** Suspend means that this method can be use in a coroutine

**   Thread.sleep(1000) sleep function sleeps the current thread
     and coroutines in the current thread

     delay(1000) function delays the current coroutine

** There are 3 different Coroutine Scopes

   IO - network calls, room persistance transactions
   Main - Main means main thread
   Default - for heavy computational work, like filter large list

** Functions in the same coroutine scope waits result of each other
